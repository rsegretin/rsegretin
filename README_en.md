### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding for a (long) while, from the back to the front and everything in-between. I've done pretty and ugly stuff, worked in big and small projects, horrible and beautiful languages and stacks. Always with coffee â˜• or mate ðŸ§‰.

Currently loving NodeJS over every other environment ðŸ’š and teaching some of it at [ComIT](https://www.comunidadit.org/)
